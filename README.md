# hello-world
So maybe Its all this basic until its not!

I am a 32 year old College Student. I lost my focus in school the first time through. as i was nearing the end of my college education, my father who had early onset parkinson disease's condition had gotten alot worse.  So Not wanting to boare you to much with that, but i made drastic decision to withdrawl from school in order to help my family. Working and helping, until I realized I wasnt acomplishing what I would like to with my life. Therefore I went back to AB tech, have done well and Now Transitioned TO Durham Tech in order to study Computer Programming. Where my Final Plan is to transfer to UNC or NC state to complete a Bachelors in computer Science.
