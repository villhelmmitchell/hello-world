So maybe Its all this basic until its not!
I am a 32-year-old College Student. I lost my focus in school the first time through. as I was nearing the end of my college education, my father who had early onset Parkinson disease's condition had gotten a lot worse.  So Not wanting to bore you too much with that, but I made drastic decision to withdraw from school to help my family. Working and helping, until I realized I wasn’t accomplishing what I would like to with my life. Therefore, I went back to AB tech, have done well and Now Transitioned TO Durham Tech to study Computer Programming. Where my Final Plan is to transfer to UNC or NC state to complete a bachelor’s in computer science
